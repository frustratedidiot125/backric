Ok so...

Two input routes ...

Do do we want Step 2 to be step one in other words... 
Do do we want increment before or after the code execution I think after right? 
That means that means adding the counter to the end, instead of the beginning so that when you pull up the session data from Alexa it's already going to be the right step number. 
And and if it isn't, then what? If it isn't defined we must Define it if there is no step otherwise specified so, there should be some sort of thing in the if chain that specifies what to do.
Two basic sub blocks before the Big Block
Basically basically if a number specified by voice, set step to voice. If voice is screwy, revert or go to next step?|if essionstep is defined, then set step variable to that|if session variable is nonexistent, then Define it?nonexistent, then Define it? And set var step = 1, and increment at end of block? And call speak by res.say("Step " + step + ". " + steps[step] + "when you're ready for the next step, say continue, or say step and the step number you wish to jump to.").shouldEndSession(false);
Then res.session +1 whatever somrbow? Maybe increment the steo number, then set it bto res.session(stepno, step) or stepup
Is there is there an easier way to do this?



Scijo divided into categories and set those as different intents or slots or sets of arrays based on slot chosen, if none then go to random. Pick a random number from 1 to 4 and then choose a category based on that number and then if one then you know execute I'm not sure how that would work but the segment for one the segment for physics instead of chemistry or you have to stick it in the Middle where it would work like between or before everything else. Like it gets to find First? As long as it's part of the Apes and not a specific intent like slots with ifs and stead of intent

      //////////////////////delete some below this line?
 // var step = (+req.session('step')) + 1; 
//           //}
 //  var slotstep = req.slot('stepno');
   
 // var step = +req.session('stepno');
  //// Now I just have to figure out how to assign steps 1 through 7 and how to go to them and whether or not to use goto or some sort of array or use if statements
  // We have to head in if step = 8 with the auto increment, then say either you're all doned exit, or reset the counter and go to zero on the res.session. 
  // Have you considered a repeat function? Like to repeat the step? Because that doesn't work in the current structure.
  // res.say step [0] will that even work?
   // if (!step) { //rewrite if step equals 1, do this, else if step equals 2, res say this, if step doesn't make any sense, Rez say I'm sorry I didn't understand what you said there. Do you want to start over? And on the last one you should say something like stepwise session should end.
      res.say("I'm Sorry, I didn't hear you right. Please try again");
    } else if (guess == number) {
      res.say("Congratulations, you guessed the number in " + guesses + (guesses == 1 ? " try" : " tries"));
    } else {
      if (guess > number) {
        res.say("Guess lower");
      } else if (guess < number) {
        res.say("Guess higher");
      } else if (guess = "??") { 
        res.say("I'm sorry, that didn't sound like an actual number. Please try again, but this time, use just your integers!");
        } else if (isNaN(guess)) {
                  res.say("I'm sorry, I didn't hear you say a number. Please try again.");
          }
